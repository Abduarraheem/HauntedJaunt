# HauntedJaunt

Dot Product has been used on the ghost to see if the ghost is facing the player and if it is then the player's turning speed will be increased by 10.
Linear interpolation has been used to change colors from yellow to completely transparent, then completely transparent to yellow, which makes it harder to see the player and it increases difficulty in darker areas. 
Particle effect has been added to indicate the where the goal is.
